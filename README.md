# Random Password Generator

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a simple Python-based password generator that produces secure and randomized passwords using letters, numbers, and special characters. This tool demonstrates how to apply core Python concepts while building a practical utility that can be used for improving security practices.

### Skills Learned

- Implementing functions in Python
- Using the random and string modules to generate randomized outputs
- Applying string concatenation and iteration techniques
- Practicing clean code formatting and documentation
- Running and debugging Python scripts inside VS Code

### Tools Used

- Python 3.12 for scripting
- Visual Studio Code as the development environment

### Quick Reference
- import - load tools.
- def - define a function.
- string.ascii_letters/digits/punctuation - prebuilt character sets.
- random.choice() - pick a random character.
- join() - combine pieces into one string.
- f"..." - format string to insert variables.

## Project Reflection

I am new to Python and coding in general, and this project served as a great introduction. I began by following a tutorial, but I decided to take it further by exploring each line of code in depth to understand how it works. My goal wasnâ€™t just to copy code but to truly learn the logic behind it.

Through this process, I learned the importance of paying close attention to syntax and double-checking every line I write. More importantly, I gained confidence in breaking down unfamiliar code into smaller, understandable parts. This project was not only about creating a password generator, but also about building a solid foundation for future coding projects.
